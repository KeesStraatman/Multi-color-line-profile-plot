# Multi colour line profile plot

ImageJ macro to plot line profiles in up to 7 channels/colours. You can select the channels you want to use to create your plot graph. You can use the macro as an action tool (will create an icon in the toolbar when the macro is installed) or run it as a standard macro in ImageJ/Fiji.

## Download code

Select the file "Plot_Multicolor4.3" and select "Raw" from the right side menu. Select all the code and copy and paste this into the text editor from ImageJ/Fiji (File > New > Text Window). Alternatively, you can download all files via the green "Code" button as a ZIP file and extract the macro file. Save this file in your macros sub-folder within the ImageJ or Fiji folder with the name Plot_Multicolor.txt.

## Run macro

To run the macro a single time open an image and via Plugins > Macros > Run... select the macro. Alternatively install it via Plugins > Macros > Install ... and the macro will be added to the Plugins > Macros menu, till you restart ImageJ/Fiji.

## Install action tool

Download and save the "Line Profile Action Tool" as described above using the name Line Profile Action Tool.txt. When you install this tool via  Plugins > Macros > Install .. an icon will be added to the ImageJ/Fiji tool bar. Clicking this icon will execute the macro code.

## Disclaimer

All the macros published on this repository can be used at your own risk. Although I did my best to ensure that they run as intended, there may be bugs, not expected use or changes to the ImageJ code that results in unexpected behaviour. If you notice a problem with any of the macros please let me know and I can try to solve the problem.
